Getting and CLeaning Data Course Project

You should create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps

    Download the data into your working directory location which will be in a UCI HAR Dataset folder.
    Save run_analysis.R to this working directory
    Run the source code using "run_analysis.R"
    An output file called "tidy.csv" will be created
    

Dependencies

All dependencies are included as library calls within the source code
